The Poisson summation conjecture of Braverman-Kazhdan, L. Lafforgue, Ngô, and Sakellaridis predicts that spherical varieties (or Whittaker induction thereof) over a global field admit a theory of Fourier analysis, including a generalized Poisson summation formula. The fiber bundle method is a technique for proving the Poisson summation conjecture for spherical varieties that can be written as a family of simpler spherical varieties for which the Poisson summation conjecture is known. In this talk, I will first explain how to relate a generalized Whittaker induction to triple product L-functions. Then I will explain the fiber bundle method and describe an approach to applying it to prove the expected analytic properties of the triple product L-functions. This is joint work with Jayce Getz, Chun-Hsien Hsu, and Spencer Leslie.

It is classically known that the special values of the partial zeta functions of real quadratic fields, or more generally, of totally real fields at negative integers are rational numbers. In this talk, I would like to discuss the denominators of these rational numbers in the case of real quadratic fields. More precisely, Duke recently presented a conjecture which gives a universal upper bound for the denominators of these special values of the partial zeta functions of real quadratic fields. I would like to explain that by using Harder's theory on the denominator of the Eisenstein class for SL(2,Z), we can prove the conjecture of Duke and moreover the sharpness of his upper bound.

In this talk, I will first determine the algebraic relations among various special gamma values over function fields. The result is based on the intrinsic relations between gamma values
in question and periods of CM dual t-motives, which are interpreted in terms of their “distributions”. This enables us to express every "abelian" CM period by a suitable product of special gamma values (up to an algebraic multiple), and derive a Chowla–Selberg-type formula in the function field case.

Certain Rankin-Selberg motives of rank n(n+1) are endowed with algebraic cycles arising from maps of unitary Shimura varieties. Gan-Gross-Prasad conjectured that these cycles are analogous to Heegner points, in the sense that their nontriviality should be detected by derivatives of L-functions.
I will propose another nontriviality criterion, based on p-adic L-functions. Under some local conditions, this variant can be established in a refined quantitative form, via the construction and comparison two p-adic relative-trace formulas. (Joint work with Wei Zhang.)

        The local-global approach to the study of rational points on varieties over number fields begins by embedding the set of rational points on a variety X into the set of its adelic points.
The Brauer--Manin pairing cuts out a subset of the adelic points, called the Brauer--Manin set, that contains the rational points. If the set of adelic points is non-empty but the Brauer--Manin set is empty then we say there's a Brauer--Manin obstruction to the existence of rational points on X.
Computing the Brauer--Manin pairing involves evaluating elements of the Brauer group of X at local points.
If an element of the Brauer group has order coprime to p, then its evaluation at a p-adic point factors via reduction of the point modulo p.
For p-torsion elements this is no longer the case: in order to compute the evaluation map one must know the point to a higher p-adic precision.
Classifying Brauer group elements according to the precision required to evaluate them at p-adic points gives a filtration which we describe using work of Bloch and Kato.
Applications of our work include addressing Swinnerton-Dyer's question about which places can play a role in the Brauer--Manin obstruction.

        This talk is based on joint work with Maria Dostert and Maryna Viazovska. We prove that the Cohn--Elkies linear programming bound is not sharp for sphere packing in dimension 6.
This is in contrast to Viazovska's sharp bound in dimension 8, even though it is believed that closely related lattices achieve the optimal densities in both dimensions.
The proof uses modular forms to construct feasible points in a dual program, generalizing a construction of Cohn and Triantafillou to the case of odd weight and non-trivial Dirichlet character.
Non-sharpness of linear programming is demonstrated by comparing this dual bound to a stronger upper bound obtained from semidefinite programming by Cohn, de Laat, and Salmon.
Our construction has vanishing Fourier coefficients along an arithmetic progression, which can be explained using skew self-adjointness of Hecke operators.

  	The investigation of L^2-Laplace eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for hyperbolic surfaces of finite area is a classical and exciting topic at the intersection of number theory, harmonic analysis and mathematical physics.
In stark contrast, for (geometrically finite) hyperbolic surfaces of infinite area, the discrete L^2-spectrum is finite.
A natural replacement are the resonances of the considered hyperbolic surface, which are the poles of the meromorphically continued resolvent of the Laplacian.<br />

These spectral entities also play an important role in number theory and various other fields, and many fascinating results about them have already been found;
the generalization of Selberg's 3/16-theorem by Bourgain, Gamburd and Sarnak is a well-known example.
However, an enormous amount of the properties of such resonances, also some very elementary ones, is still undiscovered.
A few years ago, by means of numerical experiments, Borthwick noticed for some classes of Schottky surfaces (hyperbolic surfaces of infinite area without cusps and conical singularities) that their sets of resonances exhibit unexcepted and nice patterns, which are not yet fully understood.<br />

After a brief survey of some parts of this field, we will discuss an alternative numerical method, combining tools from dynamics, zeta functions, transfer operators and thermodynamic formalism, functional analysis and approximation theory.
The emphasis of the presentation will be on motivation, heuristics and pictures. This is joint work with Oscar Bandtlow, Torben Schick and Alex Weisse.

        In April 2022, He, Lee, Oliver, and Pozdnyakov made an interesting discovery using machine learning – a surprising correlation between the root numbers of elliptic curves and the coefficients of their L-functions.
They coined this correlation 'murmurations of elliptic curves'. Naturally, one might wonder whether we can identify a common thread of 'murmurations' in other families of L-functions.

        Hardy conjectured that the error term arising from approximating the number of lattice points lying in a radius-R disc by its area is O(R<sup>1/2+o(1)</sup>).
One source of support for this conjecture is a folklore heuristic that uses i.i.d. random variables to model the lattice points lying near the boundary and square-root cancellation of sums of these random variables.
In this talk I will examine this heuristic and discuss how lattice points near the circle interact with one another.

2006. Further, multiple zeta values occur in the Fourier expansion of 
multiple Eisenstein series as computed by Bachmann. We will study this 
connection in more details on a formal level. This means, we review 
formal multiple zeta values and then introduce the algebra G^f, which 
should be seen as a formal version of multiple Eisenstein series, and 
also multiple q-zeta values and polynomial functions on partitions 
simultaneously. We will give a surjective algebra morphism from G^f into 
the algebra of formal multiple zeta values.

In a recent machine learning based study, He, Lee, Oliver, and Pozdnyakov observed a
striking
oscillating pattern in the average value of the P-th Frobenius trace of elliptic
curves of
prescribed rank and conductor in an interval range. Sutherland discovered that this
bias
extends to Dirichlet coefficients of a much broader class of arithmetic L-functions
when
split by root number. In my talk, I will discuss this root number correlation bias when
the average is taken over all weight 2 modular newforms. I will point to a source of
this

Kudla-Millson and Borcherds have proved some time ago that 
the generating series of special divisors in orthogonal Shimura 
varieties are modular forms. In this talk, I will explain an extension 
of these results to toroidal compactifications where we prove that the 
generating series is a mixed mock modular form. More precisely, we 
find an explicit completion using theta series associated to rays in 
the cone decomposition. The proof relies on intersection theory at the 
boundary of the Shimura variety. This recovers and refines recent results of Bruinier and Zemel.

In 1927, E. Artin proposed a conjecture for the number of primes p &le; x, for which g generates (&#8484;/p&#8484;)<sup>x</sup>. By observing numerical
deviations from Artin's originally predicted asymptotic, Derrick and Emma Lehmer
(1957) identified the need for an additional correction factor; leading to a
modified conjecture that was eventually proved correct by Hooley (1967), under the

several variants of Artin's conjecture: namely an "Artin Twin Primes Conjecture", as

The object of this talk is a family of q-series originating from Habiro's
work on the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants. The q-series usually make sense
only when q is a root of unity, but for some instances, it also determines a
holomorphic function on the open unit disc. Such an example is Habiro's unified WRT
invariant H(q) for the Poincare&#769; homology sphere. In 2007, Hikami observed its
discontinuity at roots of unity. More precisely, the value of H(&zeta;) at a root of
unity is 1/2 times the limit value of H(q) as q tends towards &zeta; radially within the
unit disc. In this talk, we give an explanation of the appearance of the 1/2 factor
and generalize Hikami's observations by using Bailey's lemma and the theory of
mock/false theta functions.

Faltings' theorem states that there are finitely many rational

In his series of papers from 1970s, Shimura analyzed a 
non-holomorphic operator, nowadays called the Maass-Shimura operator, 
and later extensively studied almost holomorphic modular forms. He also 
discovered their role on constructing class fields as well as the 
connection with periods of CM elliptic curves. In this talk, our first 
goal is to introduce their positive characteristic counterpart, almost 
holomorphic Drinfeld modular forms. We further relate them to Drinfeld 
quasi-modular forms which leads us to generalize the work of Bosser and 
Pellarin to a certain extend. Moreover, we introduce the Maass-Shimura 
operator $\delta_k$ in our setting for any nonnegative integer k 
and investigate the relation between the periods of CM Drinfeld modules 
and the values at CM points of arithmetic Drinfeld modular forms under 
the image of $\delta_k$.  If time permits, we also reveal how to

Quantum modular forms are functions f defined on the rationals whose period
functions, such as &#968;(x):= f(x) - x<sup>-k</sup> f(-1/x) (for level 1), satisfy some
continuity properties. In the case of k&equals;0, f can be interpreted as a Birkhoff sums
associated with the Gauss map. In particular, under mild hypotheses on G, one can
show convergence to a stable law. If k is non-zero, the situation is rather
different and we can show that mild conditions on &#968; imply that f itself has to
exhibit some continuity property. Finally, we discuss the convergence in

We prove, in this joint work with Maksym Radziwill, a 1978 conjecture of S. Patterson (conditional on the Generalised Riemann hypothesis)

This explains a well-known numerical bias in the distribution of cubic Gauss sums first observed by Kummer in 1846.

One important byproduct of our proof is that we show
Heath-Brown's cubic large sieve is sharp under GRH. 
This disproves the popular belief that the cubic large sieve can be
improved.

 An important ingredient in our proof is a dispersion estimate for cubic
 Gauss sums. It can be interpreted as a cubic large sieve with correction by a non-trivial asymptotic main term.

Wiles' modularity lifting theorem was the central argument in
        his proof of modularity of (semistable) elliptic curves over Q, and hence
of Fermat's Last Theorem. His proof relied on two key components: his
"patching" argument (developed in collaboration with Taylor) and his
numerical isomorphism criterion.

In the time since Wiles' proof, the patching argument has been generalized
extensively to prove a wide variety of modularity lifting results. In
particular Calegari and Geraghty have found a way to generalize it to prove
potential modularity of elliptic curves over imaginary quadratic fields
(contingent on some standard conjectures). The numerical criterion on the
other hand has proved far more difficult to generalize, although in
situations where it can be used it can prove stronger results than what can
be proven purely via patching.

In this talk I will present joint work with Srikanth Iyengar and
Chandrashekhar Khare which proves a generalization of the numerical
criterion to the context considered by Calegari and Geraghty (and
contingent on the same conjectures). This allows us to prove integral "R=T"
theorems at non-minimal levels over imaginary quadratic fields, which are
inaccessible by Calegari and Geraghty's method. The results provide new
evidence in favor of a torsion analog of the classical Langlands
correspondence.

  L-functions are generalizations of the Riemann zeta function.  Their

Determination of modular forms is one of the fundamental and
interesting problems in number theory. It is known that if the Hecke
eigenvalues of two newforms agree for all but finitely many primes, then
both the forms are the same. In other words, the set of Hecke eigenvalues
at primes determines the newform uniquely and this result is known as the
multiplicity one theorem. In the case of Siegel cuspidal eigenforms of
degree two, the multiplicity one theorem has been proved only recently in
2018 by Schmidt. In this talk, we refine the result of Schmidt by showing
that if the Hecke eigenvalues of two Siegel eigenforms of level 1 agree at
a set of primes of positive density, then the eigenforms are the same (up
to a constant). We also distinguish Siegel eigenforms from the signs of
their Hecke eigenvalues. The main ingredient to prove these results are
Galois representations attached to Siegel eigenforms, the Chebotarev
density theorem and some analytic properties of associated L-functions.

A Hurwitz space is a moduli space of coverings of algebraic
varieties. After fixing certain topological invariants, it is a classical
problem to classify the connected components of the resulting moduli space.
For example, the connectivity of the space of coverings of the projective
line with simple branching and fixed degree led to the first proof of the
irreducibility of M_g. In this talk I will explain a similar connectedness
result, this time in the context of SL(2,p)-covers of elliptic curves, only
branched above the origin. The connectedness result comes from combining
asymptotic results of Bourgain, Gamburd, and Sarnak with a new
combinatorial 'rigidity' coming from algebraic geometry. This rigidity
result can also be viewed as a divisibility theorem on the cardinalities of
Nielsen equivalence classes of generating pairs of finite groups. The
connectedness is a key piece of information that unlocks a number of
applications, including a conjecture of Bourgain, Gamburd and Sarnak on a
strong approximation property of the Markoff equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xyz$
= 0, a noncongruence analog of Rademacher's conjecture of the genus of

The study of hyperbolic 3-manifolds draws deep connections between number
theory, geometry, topology, and quantum mechanics. Specifically, the closed
geodesics on a manifold are intrinsically related to the eigenvalues of
Maass forms via the Selberg trace formula and are parametrized by their
length and holonomy, which describes the angle of rotation by parallel
transport along the geodesic. The trace formula for spherical Maass forms
can be used to prove the Prime Geodesic Theorem, which provides an
asymptotic count of geodesics up to a certain length. I will present an
asymptotic count of geodesics (obtained via the non-spherical trace
formula) by length and holonomy in prescribed intervals which are allowed
to shrink independently. This count implies effective equidistribution of
holonomy and substantially sharpens the result of Sarnak and Wakayama in
the context of compact hyperbolic 3-manifolds. I will then discuss new
results regarding biases in the finer distribution of holonomy.

of CM values and geodesic cycle integrals of different modular functions.
First we define modular forms and harmonic Maass forms. Then we briefly discuss the
theory of theta lifts that gives a conceptual framework for such generating series.
We end with some applications of the theory.

For certain automorphic representations $\pi$ on unitary groups, we show
that if $L(s, \pi)$ vanishes to order one at the center $s=1/2$, then the
associated $\pi$-localized Chow group of a unitary Shimura variety is
nontrivial. This proves part of the Beilinson-Bloch conjecture for unitary
Shimura varieties, which generalizes the BSD conjecture. Assuming Kudla's
modularity conjecture, we further prove the arithmetic inner product
formula for $L'(1/2, \pi)$, which generalizes the Gross-Zagier formula. We
will motivate these conjectures and discuss some aspects of the proof. We
will also mention recent extensions applicable to symmetric power
L-functions of elliptic curves. This is joint work with Yifeng Liu.

The Rademacher symbol is algebraically expressed as a conjugacy class
invariant quasimorphism PSL(2,Z) -> Z. It was first studied in connection to
Dedekind's eta-function, but soon enough appeared to be connected to class numbers
of real quadratic fields, the Hirzebruch signature theorem, or linking numbers of
knots. I will explain
 (1) how, using continued fractions, Psi can be realized as the winding number for
closed curves on the modular surface around the cusp;
 (2) how, using Eisenstein series, one can naturally construct a Rademacher symbol
for any cusp of a general noncocompact Fuchsian group;

Cycle integrals of the j-function are expected to play a role in the
real quadratic analog of singular moduli.

However, it is not clear how one can consider cycle integrals as a  "continuous"
function on real quadratic numbers.

In this talk, we extend the definition of cycle integrals of the j-function from
real quadratic numbers to badly approximable numbers to seek an appropriate
continuity.

We also give some explicit representations for extended-cycle integrals in some
cases which can be considered as a partial result of continuity of cycle integrals.

Modular forms play a prominent role in the classical as well as
in modern number theory. In the theory of modular forms, there is an
important class of functions called Poincar&#233; series. These functions are
very mysterious and there are many unsolved problems about them. In
particular, the vanishing or non-vanishing of such functions is still
unknown in full generality. In a special case, the latter problem is
equivalent to the famous Lehmer's conjecture which is one of the classical
open problems in the theory. In this talk, I will speak about when these
functions are non-zero for Hilbert modular forms, a natural generalization
of modular forms for totally real number fields.

		      Due to a result by Vigneras from 1977, there is a quite simple way to determine whether a certain theta series admits modular transformation properties. To be more specific, she showed that solving a differential equation of second order serves as a criterion for modularity. We generalize this result for Siegel theta series of arbitrary genus n. In order to do so, we construct Siegel theta series for indefinite quadratic forms by considering functions which solve an (n x n)-system of partial differential equations. These functions do not only give examples of Siegel theta series, but build a basis of the family of Schwartz functions that generate series which transform like modular forms.

As was shown by Hickerson in the 70's, the classical Dedekind sums s(d, c) can be represented as sums over the coefficients of the continued fraction expansion of the rational d / c. Hardy sums, the analogous integer-valued objects arising in the transformation of the logarithms of theta functions under a subgroup of the modular group, have been shown to satisfy many properties which mirror the properties of the classical Dedekind sums. The representation as coefficients of continued fractions has, however, been missing so far. In this talk, I will argue how one can fill this gap. As an application, I will present a new proof for the fact that the graph of the Hardy sums is dense in R x Z, which was previously proved by Meyer.

            In the early 20th century, Hecke studied the diagonal restrictions of Eisenstein series over real quadratic fields. An infamous sign error caused him to miss an important feature, which later lead to highly influential developments in the theory of complex multiplication (CM) initiated by Gross and Zagier in their famous work on Heegner points on elliptic curves. In this talk, we will explore what happens when we replace the imaginary quadratic fields in CM theory with real quadratic fields, and propose a framework for a tentative 'RM theory', based on the notion of rigid meromorphic cocycles, introduced in joint work with Henri Darmon. I will discuss several of their arithmetic properties, and their apparent relevance in the study of explicit class field theory of real quadratic fields. This concerns various joint works, with Henri Darmon, Alice Pozzi, and Yingkun Li.

We describe local Hecke algebras of GL_2 and double cover of SL_2 with certain level structures and use it to give a newform theory. In the integral weight setting, our method allows us to give a characterization of the newspace of any level as a common eigenspace of certain finitely many pair of conjugate operators that we obtain from local Hecke algebras. In specific cases, we can completely describe local Whittaker functions associated to a new form. In the half-integral weight setting, we give an analogous characterization of the newspace for the full space of half-integral weight forms of level 8M, M odd and square-free and observe that the forms in the newspace space satisfy a Fourier coefficient condition that gives the complement of the plus space.

Duke, Imamoḡlu, and Tóth have recently constructed a new geometric invariant, a hyperbolic orbifold, associated to each narrow ideal class of a real quadratic field. Furthermore, they have shown that the projection of these hyperbolic orbifolds onto the modular surface equidistributes on average over a genus of the narrow class group as the fundamental discriminan of the real quadratic field tends to infinity. We discuss a refinement of this result, sparse equidistribution, where one averages over smaller subgroups of the narrow class group: we connect this to cycle integrals of automorphic forms and subconvexity for Rankin-Selberg L-functions.

Congruences of Fourier coefficients of modular forms have long been an object of central study. By comparison, the arithmetic of other expansions of modular forms, in particular Taylor expansions around points in the upper-half plane, has been much less studied. Recently, Romik made a conjecture about the periodicity of coefficients around $\tau=i$ of the classical Jacobi theta function. Here, in joint work with Michael Mertens and Pavel Guerzhoy, we prove this conjecture and generalize the phenomenon observed by Romik to a general class of modular forms of half-integral weight.</div>

        In recent years there has been a lot of interest in explicitly identifying the global Arthur parameters attached to certain automorphic forms. In particular Chenevier and Lannes were able to completely identify and prove the full lists of Arthur parameters in the case of level 1, trivial weight automorphic forms for definite orthogonal groups of ranks 8, 16 and 24 (not a simple task!).
<br />
One finds interesting modular forms hidden in these parameters (e.g. Delta and a handful of special Siegel modular forms of genus 2). Comparing Arthur parameters mod p proves/reproves various Eisenstein congruences for these special modular forms, e.g. the famous 691 congruence of Ramanujan and, more importantly, an example of a genus 2 Eisenstein congruence predicted by Harder (which, up to then, had not been proved for even a single modular form!).
<br />
In this talk I will discuss recent work with Neil Dummigan on extending the above to definite orthogonal groups over certain real quadratic fields and try to tell the analogous Arthurian tales (mysteries included).

                Hurwitz class numbers, class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields, and
                partition counts are among the most classic quantities in number theory,
                and for each of them their factorizations, i.e. divisibilities, are
                celebrated open questions. In the case of class numbers the
                Cohen-Lehnstra Heuristics provides predictions of of statistical nature.
                In the case of partition counts, Ramanujan's congruences have been known
                since~1920 and extended by many including key results by Atkin in the
                60ies and Ono around 2000.

                We investigate the case of divisibility patterns as opposed to
                divisibility statistics for Hurwitz class numbers. The Hurwitz class
                number formula implies Ramanujan-type congruences, which in contrary to
                known congruences for mock theta series can be supported on generating
                series with non-holomorphic modular completion. We prove a result that
                limits the possibilities of such "non-holomorphic" Ramanujan-type
                congruences. When combined with experimental data, this provides
                evidence that all of them arise from the class number formula.

holes of the Leech lattice, the unique Niemeier lattice without roots.

We generalise this statement to vertex operator algebras (VOAs), i.e. we
show that all 71 holomorphic VOAs (or meromorphic 2-dimensional
conformal field theories) of central charge 24 correspond to generalised
deep holes of the Leech lattice VOA.

The notion of generalised deep hole occurs naturally as an upper bound

with a certain vector-valued Eisenstein series of weight 2.

A classical result of Eichler, Shimura and Manin asserts that the map that assigns to a cusp form f its period polynomial r_f is a Hecke equivariant map. We propose a generalization of this result  to a setting  where r_f  is replaced by a family of rational function of N variables equipped with the action of GLN(Z). For this purpose, we develop a theory of Hecke operators for the elliptic cocycle recently introduced by Charollois.  In particular,  when f is an eigenform, the corresponding rational function is also an eigenvector respect to Hecke operator for GLN. Finally, we give some examples  for Eisenstein series and the Ramanujan Delta function.

        The Shintani lift is a classical construction of modular
forms of half-integral weight from modular forms of even integral
weight. Soon after its definition it was shown to be related to
integration with respect to theta kernel. The development of the theory
of regularized integrals opens the question to what modular forms of
half-integral weight arise as regularized Shintani lifts of various
kinds of integral weight modular forms. We evaluate these lifts for the
case of nearly holomorphic modular forms, which in particular shows
that when the depth is smaller than the weight, the Shintani lift is
also nearly holomorphic. This evaluation requires the determination of
certain Fourier transforms, which are interesting on their own right.
